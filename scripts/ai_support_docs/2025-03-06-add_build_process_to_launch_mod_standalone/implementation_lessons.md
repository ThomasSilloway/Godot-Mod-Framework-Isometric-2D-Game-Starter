# Implementation Lessons - Standalone Mod Build Process

## Issues Not Covered in Original Spec

1. Run Game Utility Adaptation
   - The spec didn't specify that the `run_game` utility needed to be modified to handle both standalone and startup executables
   - Had to add a new `exe_name` parameter to `run_game` function to support different executable names
   - Had to implement fallback logic to try both .console.exe and .exe variants

2. Build Process Dependencies
   - Python dependencies needed updating to include "godot-parser>=0.0.1"
   - This wasn't specified in the original spec but was necessary for proper functionality

3. Executable Name Handling
   - The spec didn't clarify how executable names should be handled
   - Had to modify the build process to use the mod name for the executable instead of hardcoding "startup"
   - Added logic to check for both .console.exe and .exe variants when running the game

4. Error Handling Specifics
   - The spec mentioned error handling but didn't detail specific cases
   - Had to add detailed error messages for:
     - Missing executable files
     - Failed builds
     - Game launch failures

## Improvements for Future Specs

1. Execution Environment
   - Explicitly specify all required Python dependencies
   - Document any assumptions about the execution environment

2. File Naming Conventions
   - Clearly specify how executable names should be generated
   - Document expected file extensions and variants

3. Error Handling Requirements
   - List specific error conditions that need to be handled
   - Specify required error messages and exit codes

4. Utility Function Modifications
   - Identify existing utilities that need modification
   - Specify new parameters and behavior changes needed

5. Testing Scenarios
   - Include both success and failure test cases
   - Specify expected behavior for error conditions
