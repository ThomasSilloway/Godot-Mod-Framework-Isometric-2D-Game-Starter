# Bug 01: Wall Detector Node Creation

## Problem
The wall detector is currently being created via script and added as a child node during runtime. This can cause issues with node initialization and referencing in the test scene.

## Possible Solutions

### Solution 1: Add Wall Detector in Scene File
- Add the wall_collision_detector.gd as a child node in test_navigation_collision_scene.tscn
- Have a_star_2d_navigation.gd find the existing node rather than creating one
- **Pros**: 
  - More consistent with Godot's node-based architecture
  - Makes dependencies clearer in the scene tree
  - Easier to debug and inspect in editor
- **Cons**:
  - Requires adding the node to every scene that uses navigation
  - Less control over initialization order

### Solution 2: Use Dependency Injection
- Pass wall detector reference to a_star_2d_navigation.gd from parent
- Create wall detector elsewhere and inject it
- **Pros**:
  - More flexible and testable
  - Clear dependencies
  - Easier to mock for testing
- **Cons**:
  - More complex architecture
  - Requires changes to existing code that uses navigation
  - May complicate scene setup

### Solution 3: Create as Internal Resource
- Create wall detector as an internal resource rather than a Node2D
- Handle wall detection purely through data structures
- **Pros**:
  - Simpler dependency management
  - No scene tree dependencies
  - More performant
- **Cons**:
  - Loses benefits of node system
  - More difficult to debug visually
  - May require significant refactoring

## Selected Solution
Solution 1: Add Wall Detector in Scene File

### Rationale
- Best matches Godot's architecture and design patterns
- Most maintainable and debuggable
- Simplest to implement with minimal changes
- Keeps visual debugging capabilities

### Implementation Steps
1. Add WallCollisionDetector node to test_navigation_collision_scene.tscn
2. Update a_star_2d_navigation.gd to find existing node
3. Remove runtime node creation code
4. Update references in debug visualization
