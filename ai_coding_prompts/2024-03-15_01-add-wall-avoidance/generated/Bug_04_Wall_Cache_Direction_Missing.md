# Bug Analysis: Incomplete Wall Direction Caching

## Bug Description
Some walls are not properly cached in the wall_collision_detector.gd system, specifically related to handling all 8 directions from any given node.

## Possible Solutions

### Solution 1: Enhanced Cache Initialization
- **Approach**: Modify _ready() to check wall presence in all 8 directions during cache initialization
- **Changes**:
  - Update cache key generation to handle diagonal checks
  - Add diagonal wall checks based on orthogonal wall combinations
  - Pre-cache all possible wall combinations during initialization
- **Pros**:
  - Complete coverage of all directions
  - Consistent with existing caching strategy
- **Cons**:
  - Higher memory usage for cache storage
  - More complex initialization logic

### Solution 2: Dynamic Wall Detection
- **Approach**: Remove caching and check walls dynamically
- **Changes**:
  - Remove _wall_cache dictionary
  - Implement real-time wall checks for all directions
  - Update has_wall_between() to check orthogonal walls for diagonal movement
- **Pros**:
  - Simpler code structure
  - Lower memory usage
- **Cons**:
  - Higher runtime performance cost
  - May break existing test expectations

### Solution 3: Hybrid Caching System
- **Approach**: Cache orthogonal walls only, derive diagonal blockages
- **Changes**:
  - Keep existing orthogonal wall cache
  - Add logic to compute diagonal blockage from cached orthogonal walls
  - Update has_wall_between() to handle both cached and computed cases
- **Pros**:
  - Balanced memory and performance
  - Maintains existing test compatibility
  - More maintainable code structure
- **Cons**:
  - Slightly more complex wall checking logic

## Selected Solution
Solution 3: Hybrid Caching System is recommended because:
1. Maintains compatibility with existing test sequences
2. Provides efficient storage while handling all directions
3. Clear separation between cached data and computed blockages
4. More maintainable and easier to debug

## Implementation Notes
- Keep existing cache structure for NESW walls
- Add helper methods to check diagonal blockage
- Update wall detection to handle all 8 directions consistently
- Preserve all debug logging for troubleshooting
