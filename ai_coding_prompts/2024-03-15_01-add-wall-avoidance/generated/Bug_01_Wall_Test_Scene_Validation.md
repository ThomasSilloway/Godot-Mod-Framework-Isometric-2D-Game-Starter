# Bug Analysis: Wall Test Scene Validation

## Potential Issues

1. Scene Loading in Tests
   - **Problem**: Test might fail if scene structure changes
   - **Solution**: Add more robust scene validation in before_all()
   - **Impact**: Medium - Tests would fail early with clear message

2. Grid/World Coordinate Conversion
   - **Problem**: Edge cases in coordinate conversion might affect tests
   - **Solution**: Add coordinate conversion validation tests
   - **Impact**: Low - Core functionality works well

3. Wall Detection Cache
   - **Problem**: Cache might affect test repeatability
   - **Solution**: Clear wall detection cache before each test
   - **Impact**: Low - Tests should still pass

## Chosen Solution

Implementing Solution 3 as it's the most critical for test reliability:
- Add cache clearing in before_each()
- Ensures each test runs with fresh state
- Minimal impact on existing code
