# Feature Overview

  Update a_star_2d_navigation.gd to respect colliders like walls. For example if there's a wall between 0,0 and 0,-1 those two cells should not be connected and the player should not try to run directly there, it should run around the wall

## Project Details
 - Use only Godot 4.4 syntax
 - The tile size is 256x128, using isometric tiles, Diamond Down layout

## Technical Clarifications
 - The current A* implementation completely ignores walls
 - Movement should use cardinal directions (N-E-S-W) when handling wall collisions
 - When no walls are encountered, the player can move in all 8 directions
 - The TileMapLayer-Walls-East/West/North/South nodes are already implemented in the test scene
 - Debug visualization is already implemented with export variables that can be toggled on/off
