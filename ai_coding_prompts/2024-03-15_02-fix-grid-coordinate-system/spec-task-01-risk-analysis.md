# Overview

  There was a typo in ai_coding_prompts\2024-03-13_01-pathing-a-star-non-grid\spec.md where it said the player was at world position 0,0 and grid position 0,0. The player is actually at world position 0,0 and grid position -1, 0. 

   This probably has far reaching effects into multiple files.

   - Need to fix the issue so the world_debug_draw.gd file shows the correct grid positions
   - Fix a_star_2d_navigation.gd to use the correct grid position

## Project Details
 - Use only Godot 4.4 syntax
 - The tile size is 256x128, using isometric tiles, Diamond Down layout
 - The player is at world position 0,0 and grid position -1, 0    

## IMPORTANT
 - DO NOT EDIT ANY CODE 

## Tasks

### Review Feature list
 - Review [Feature List](projects/isometric_2d_prototype/feature_list.md) to understand the current project

#### Risk Assessment
- Create a risks document under the folder: generated called risk_assessment.md
- Identify potential implementation challenges or risks
- For each risk, provide a mitigation strategy
- Consider edge cases (e.g., negative coordinates, boundary conditions)
- Document any areas where the implementation might diverge from existing systems
