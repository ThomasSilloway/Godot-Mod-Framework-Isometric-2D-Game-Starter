# 2d isometric game built with godot 4.4

## High Level Overview
 We need a feature list for the isometric 2D game. The feature list should include all the features that are currently implemented in the game. Each feature should be described in detail, including its purpose, how it works, and any relevant technical specifications. The feature list should also include any known bugs or limitations of the current implementation.
