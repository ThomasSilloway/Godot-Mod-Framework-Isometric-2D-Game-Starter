# Bug Analysis: Signal Connection Issues

## Bug Description
The refactored code may encounter issues with signal connections between the A* navigation system and the debug visualization component if the node paths or unique names are incorrect.

## Potential Solutions

### Solution 1: Use Direct Node References
- **Approach**: Store a direct reference to the navigation node in the World Debug Draw script.
- **Implementation**: In `_ready()`, search for the navigation node using multiple strategies (parent search, get_tree().get_nodes_in_group(), etc.)
- **Pros**: Most reliable way to ensure connection
- **Cons**: Creates tighter coupling between components, less flexible for scene restructuring

### Solution 2: Use NodePath Export Variable
- **Approach**: Add an @export variable to specify the path to the navigation node.
- **Implementation**: Add `@export var navigation_path: NodePath` and use `get_node(navigation_path)` to access it
- **Pros**: Configurable in the editor, flexible for different scene structures
- **Cons**: Requires manual configuration, can break if scene structure changes

### Solution 3: Use Unique Name References (Current Implementation)
- **Approach**: Rely on Godot's unique name system with `%Name` pattern
- **Implementation**: Current implementation using `get_node_or_null("%Isometric-Navigation")`
- **Pros**: Decoupled from specific paths, works regardless of node hierarchy
- **Cons**: Depends on consistent naming across the project

## Evaluation
Solution 3 (current implementation) provides the best balance between flexibility and maintainability. It ensures loose coupling between components while still establishing reliable connections. The unique naming system is a built-in Godot feature designed specifically for this purpose.

## Implementation Notes
To ensure robustness, we should add error handling in the World Debug Draw script to gracefully handle cases where the navigation node cannot be found:

1. Log appropriate warnings when connections fail
2. Ensure the script continues to function even without signal connections
3. Consider adding a retry mechanism or deferred connection attempt

By addressing these considerations, we maintain the separation of concerns while ensuring reliable communication between components.
