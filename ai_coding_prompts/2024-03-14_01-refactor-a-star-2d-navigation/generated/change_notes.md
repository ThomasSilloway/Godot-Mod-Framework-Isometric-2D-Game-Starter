# A* 2D Navigation Refactoring Change Notes

## v01 Initial Implementation
- Created change_notes.md to track implementation changes
- Planning implementation of composition-based approach for A* navigation
- Separating navigation logic from visualization

## v02 Core Implementation
- Updated a_star_2d_navigation.gd to implement signal emissions
- Moved all drawing code from navigation system to world_debug_draw.gd
- Implemented signal-based communication between components:
  - path_calculated - Emits the calculated path for visualization
  - pathfinding_progress_updated - Emits progress data for debugging display
- Ensured proper node references using Godot's unique name referencing system

## v03 Implementation Verification
- Confirmed proper separation of concerns:
  - a_star_2d_navigation.gd only handles pathfinding logic and emits signals
  - world_debug_draw.gd receives signals and handles all visualization
- Validated that core navigation remains agnostic to visualization
- Confirmed signals provide all necessary data for debugging visualization
- Maintained original functionality while improving code organization

## v04 API Integration Fix - Update Calling Code
- Analyzed the available solutions in Bug_01_Signal_Connection_API_Incompatibility.md
- Chose Solution 2: Update all calling code to use the debug component directly
- Updated the character_controller_point_and_click.gd file to:
  - Cache a reference to the debug draw component at startup
  - Call highlight_tile_at() directly on the debug draw component
  - Pass both world position and tile coordinate parameters
- This approach maintains clean separation of concerns by having each component
  call the appropriate service directly, rather than going through adapters

## v05 Integration Test Verification
- Ran integration tests successfully
- Verified that:
  - Navigation system initializes correctly with proper grid setup
  - Path calculation works as expected
  - Character movement follows calculated paths
  - Debug visualization properly shows movement and grid information
- All assertions passed with no errors
- Confirmed Solution 2 (direct debug component reference) works correctly

## v06 Debug Visualization Fix
- Added grid_updated signal to navigation system to notify debug visualization when grid points are ready
- Updated debug visualization to connect to grid_updated signal
- Fixed issue with coordinate display not showing up when _debug_show_coordinates is enabled
- Added immediate grid point synchronization during component initialization

## v07 Debug Grid Point Synchronization Fix
- Identified bug where grid coordinates weren't displaying when _debug_show_coordinates was enabled
- Created Bug_03_Grid_Points_Not_Synced.md analysis document
- Implemented Solution 2 with grid_updated signal for proper synchronization
- Added immediate grid point fetching during initialization
- Verified coordinates now display properly when debug visualization starts
