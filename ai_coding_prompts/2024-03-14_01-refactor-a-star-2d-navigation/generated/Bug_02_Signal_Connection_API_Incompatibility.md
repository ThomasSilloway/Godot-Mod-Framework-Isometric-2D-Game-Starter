# Bug Analysis: Signal Connection and API Incompatibility

## Bug Description
Our refactored code introduces an API incompatibility with existing code that expects specific methods on the navigation system. The error "Invalid call. Nonexistent function 'highlight_tile_at' in base 'Node2D (a_star_2d_navigation.gd)'" indicates that external components are trying to call visualization methods that we've moved to the debug visualization component.

## Potential Solutions

### Solution 1: Add Forwarding Methods to Navigation System
- **Approach**: Add methods in the A* navigation system that forward calls to the debug visualization system
- **Implementation**: Add methods like `highlight_tile_at()` in the navigation script that call the corresponding methods on the debug system
- **Pros**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- **Cons**: Creates coupling between components we're trying to separate

### Solution 2: Update All Calling Code
- **Approach**: Identify all callers of visualization methods and update them to call the debug component directly
- **Implementation**: Find all instances where visualization methods are called and modify them to target the debug component instead
- **Pros**: Maintains clean separation of concerns
- **Cons**: Requires changes to potentially many places in the codebase

### Solution 3: Hybrid Approach with Interface Adaptation
- **Approach**: Use a temporary adaptation layer that preserves the public API while delegating to the appropriate component
- **Implementation**: Keep the methods in the navigation system but implement them to delegate to the visualization component through signals or direct reference
- **Pros**: Maintains backward compatibility while still achieving separation internally
- **Cons**: Adds temporary complexity until all calling code can be updated

## Evaluation
Solution 3 provides the best balance between immediate compatibility and architectural goals. By implementing a temporary adaptation layer, we can maintain compatibility with existing code while still benefiting from the separation of concerns internally.

## Implementation Plan
1. Identify all visualization methods that external code expects to call on the navigation system
2. Add those methods back to the navigation system, but make them delegate to the visualization component
3. Add a direct reference from the navigation system to the debug visualization component
4. Update the `_ready()` method to find the debug component
5. Gradually update calling code to use the debug component directly
6. Once all code has been updated, mark the forwarding methods as deprecated

This approach allows us to maintain compatibility while also encouraging callers to update to the new architecture over time.
