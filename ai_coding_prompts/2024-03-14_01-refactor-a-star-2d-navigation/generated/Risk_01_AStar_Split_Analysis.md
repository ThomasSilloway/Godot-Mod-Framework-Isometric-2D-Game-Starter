# A* Navigation Code Split Analysis

## Option 1: Inheritance-Based Split
- Core class defines base functionality
- Debug class inherits and adds visualization
### Pros:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to extend debug functionality
### Cons:
- Tight coupling between classes
- Potential performance overhead from inheritance
- More complex to test

## Option 2: Composition-Based Split
- Core class handles pure pathfinding
- Separate debug class observes core class
### Pros:
- Looser coupling
- More flexible for testing
- Better encapsulation
### Cons:
- Requires careful event/signal handling
- Slightly more complex initial setup
- Need to manage debug class lifecycle

## Option 3: Interface-Based Split
- Define interface for pathfinding operations
- Separate implementations for core and debug
### Pros:
- Maximum flexibility
- Easiest to test
- Clear contract between components
### Cons:
- More files to manage
- Potential duplication of some code
- Overhead from interface abstractions

## Decision
Going with Option 2 (Composition-Based Split) because:
1. Provides good balance of coupling and cohesion
2. Aligns well with Godot's signal system
3. Easier to unit test both components independently
4. More maintainable in the long term

## Implementation Plan
1. Extract core A* functionality to new class
2. Create debug visualization class
3. Set up signal system for communication
4. Add integration tests for both classes
