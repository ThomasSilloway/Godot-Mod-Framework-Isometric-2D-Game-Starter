# 2d isometric game built with godot 4.4

# Overview


# See the [Feature List](projcts/isometric_2d_prototype/feature_list.md) for a summary of the project's features.
# See the [High Level Overview](./spec-overview.md) for a summary of the task.
# See the [Risk Assessment](./generated/Risk_01_AStar_Split_Analysis) for a summary of the risks.
# See the [Spec Proposed File Structure](./spec-proposed-file-structure.md) for a summary of the proposed file structure.

## Doc Details
  - Create each file below inside the current directory of this spec file under the folder: generated

## Tasks

### Read the relevant docs referenced above
 - Read any relevant documentation from the ai_docs folder
 - Read any of the related .gd and .tscn files in the project directory

### Read feature_list.md
 - Previously you updated the feature_list.md to reflect the new feature
 
### Create a detailed architecture document with an overview
  Include the following sections:
  - Architecture Overview
    - Provide a high-level overview of the architecture
    - Include a diagram of the architecture
    - Describe the main components and their interactions

### Continue the architecture doc with these sections
  - API Research and Limitations
    - Research the key APIs/classes that will be used
    - Document any limitations, edge cases, or gotchas discovered
    - Create small proof-of-concept code to verify assumptions about the API behavior
    - Link to relevant documentation or discussions about the API
 - Requirements Clarification
    - Restate each requirement in precise technical terms
    - Provide visual diagrams or pseudocode for complex concepts
    - Define ambiguous terms (e.g., "connect nodes" could mean direct connections or adjacent connections)
    - List any assumptions being made about requirements
  - Design Patterns and Precedent
    - Research how similar functionality is implemented in other projects
    - Document relevant design patterns that could be applied
    - Note any previous implementations within the project that could serve as examples
    - Identify common pitfalls in similar implementations

### Create change_notes.md file
 - For each set of changes you implement, add a new section with:
  - ## Version title Ex: v01 - Architecture Plan Created
    - A brief description of the changes made
    - Details of what was implemented/fixed
    - If it's documentation only, specify that
 - Always append new changes as a new section at the bottom of the file, keeping the previous change notes intact

### Double check your planning documents
 - Pretend to be an coding architect reviewer and review the documents and make any changes if necessary
 - Make sure to question high level and detailed design decisions

### Wrap up
 - Let me know when you are done with these tasks and I will review the documents. Do not proceed to implementing code.
