Keeps getting stuck on the architecture doc, so maybe I'm adding too much data in the reading section & should remove that and just include each of the relevant files in the prompt.

Or maybe we don't even need this step at all? We already were able to make changes to the proposed file structure & spec overview and feature list. Maybe it has enough info to do the implementation now.
