It keeps timing out making the architecture doc, I think it's using too much context and getting bogged down.

In the future, try to use only the context really needed to get the job done.

We created useful things though
 - Feature list - could be broken into smaller files if needed
 - Risk analysis - Helped figure out how to set up the changes
 - Proposed file structure - Created via using risk analysis iterating over the manual structure that I put together

 Keeps getting node references wrong, so maybe we can add something to the implementation details about this for the future
