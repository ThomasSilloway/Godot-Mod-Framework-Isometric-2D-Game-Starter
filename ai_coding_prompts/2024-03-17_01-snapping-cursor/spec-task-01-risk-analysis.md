# Overview

  I recently added node called Cursor. Right now it's a simple sprite. When it's at position 0,0 it's correctly algned with the tile grid. I want to add a script to the Cursor node that will snap the cursor to the nearest tile when the mouse as the mouse is moved around.

### Review Feature list
 - Review [Feature List](projects/isometric_2d_prototype/feature_list.md) to understand the current project

#### Risk Assessment
- Create a risks document under the folder: generated called risk_assessment.md
- Identify potential implementation challenges or risks
- For each risk, provide a mitigation strategy
- Consider edge cases (e.g., negative coordinates, boundary conditions)
- Document any areas where the implementation might diverge from existing systems
