# Risk Assessment: Cursor Snapping Feature

## Overview
This document assesses potential risks and challenges in implementing cursor snapping functionality in the Isometric 2D Prototype project. The feature will snap a cursor sprite to the nearest tile grid position as the mouse moves around the scene.

## Implementation Context
- The Cursor node is a simple sprite currently positioned at (0,0) in the scene
- The cursor needs to snap to the nearest tile using existing coordinate conversion functions
- The project uses isometric Diamond Down layout with 256x128 pixel tiles
- The cursor should instantly snap to tiles (no smoothing/interpolation)
- The cursor should snap to all areas of the tilemap

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Coordinate Conversion Accuracy
**Description:**
The existing coordinate conversion functions might not provide perfect snapping, especially at tile boundaries or with floating-point precision issues.

**Potential Impact:**
- Cursor might appear slightly misaligned with tiles
- Jittering when the mouse is at the exact boundary between tiles
- Incorrect tile selection for game mechanics that rely on cursor position

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Leverage the existing `_world_to_grid` and `_grid_to_world` functions in `a_star_2d_navigation.gd` which are already handling this conversion
- Add additional validation to ensure the cursor is exactly centered on tiles
- Consider adding a small threshold/deadzone at tile boundaries to prevent rapid switching

### Risk 2: Performance with Continuous Mouse Movement
**Description:**
Constant position updates and coordinate conversions could impact performance, especially if many calculations are performed each frame.

**Potential Impact:**
- Frame rate drops during rapid mouse movement
- Delayed visual feedback
- Potential conflicts with other input processing

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Only update cursor position when the mouse actually moves
- Optimize the conversion process to minimize calculations
- Consider throttling updates if performance issues arise (though instant snapping is required)

### Risk 3: Edge Case Handling for Map Boundaries
**Description:**
The cursor might behave unexpectedly when the mouse moves beyond the tilemap boundaries.

**Potential Impact:**
- Cursor disappears or snaps to incorrect positions
- Errors when trying to snap to non-existent grid positions
- Inconsistent behavior at map edges

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Use the `_map_rect` boundary information from the navigation system
- Implement boundary checking to keep the cursor within valid tile positions
- Define clear behavior for when the mouse is outside the valid map area (either snap to closest valid tile or hide)

---

### Risk 4: Visual Feedback for Different Z-Levels
**Description:**
In an isometric environment with multiple layers, it may not be clear which layer the cursor is snapping to.

**Potential Impact:**
- User confusion about which tile is currently selected
- Difficulty targeting specific tiles in complex areas
- Inconsistent selection behavior

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Ensure clear visual indication of the selected tile
- Consider utilizing both the Front and Back sprites in the Cursor node to provide depth cues
- Add visual indication of the currently selected layer if necessary

---

### Risk 5: Integration with Existing Navigation System
**Description:**
The cursor snapping might need to integrate with the existing navigation system to correctly highlight navigable areas.

**Potential Impact:**
- Cursor might snap to non-navigable areas without proper indication
- Inconsistency between cursor position and actual valid movement targets
- Conflicts between cursor snapping logic and navigation logic

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Establish clear separation between cursor visual position and navigation target validation
- Consider adding optional visual indication for non-navigable tiles
- Reuse existing navigation system methods for consistency

---

### Risk 6: Code Organization and Maintenance
**Description:**
Adding cursor snapping as a standalone feature might lead to code duplication or inconsistent handling of coordinate systems.

**Potential Impact:**
- Multiple places in code handling the same coordinate conversions
- Difficulty maintaining consistency if the underlying system changes
- Challenges when debugging coordinate-related issues

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Create a self-contained script that references the navigation system for coordinate conversions
- Document dependencies clearly within the code
- Consider creating a shared utility class for coordinate conversions if this pattern becomes common

---

### Risk 7: Negative Coordinates Handling
**Description:**
The system needs to correctly handle negative coordinates, which has been a source of bugs in the past.

**Potential Impact:**
- Incorrect snapping for tiles in negative coordinate space
- Inconsistent behavior depending on cursor location
- Potential errors if coordinate conversion doesn't account for negative values

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Ensure the cursor snapping uses the same offset system as the navigation to handle negative coordinates
- Test extensively with negative coordinate positions
- Review the existing fix for negative AStar point IDs to understand the underlying issue

---

## Edge Cases to Consider

1. **Mouse at exact tile boundaries:** Define clear rules for which tile gets selected
2. **Mouse outside the game window:** Determine how cursor behaves when focus is lost
3. **Multiple overlapping tiles:** Define selection priority if needed
4. **Very fast mouse movement:** Ensure snapping remains accurate at high movement speeds
5. **Integration with click events:** Ensure the snapped position is what gets used for interaction events

## Conclusion

The cursor snapping feature is relatively straightforward to implement using existing coordinate conversion functions. The primary risks involve ensuring accurate positioning, handling edge cases at boundaries, and maintaining consistency with the existing systems. Most risks can be mitigated by leveraging the well-established coordinate conversion functions and adding proper validation and boundary checking.
