# Change Notes

## v01 - Grid Utility Refactoring
- Created a new utility class `UtilGrid` to centralize coordinate conversion functions
- Extracted the following functionality from a_star_2d_navigation.gd:
  - world_to_grid: Convert world coordinates to grid coordinates
  - grid_to_world: Convert grid coordinates to world coordinates
  - get_tile_center: Get the center position of a tile
  - get_closest_valid_grid_position: Find valid grid positions
- Created unit tests to verify functionality of the new utility class
- Updated a_star_2d_navigation.gd to use the new utility class
- Updated existing tests to work with the refactored code
- Benefits:
  - Better separation of concerns
  - Reusable coordinate conversion across multiple components
  - Centralized handling of coordinate transformations
  - Simplified code maintenance

## v02 - Implementation Review
- Added wrapper methods in a_star_2d_navigation.gd for backward compatibility
- Updated all three affected test files to use the new UtilGrid class
- Added defensive error handling in the utility class for robustness
- Maintained the same coordinate conversion logic for consistency
- All functions properly handle both positive and negative coordinates
- Added comprehensive documentation to all utility functions
- Double-checked that features from feature_list.md were not broken:
  - AStar2D Navigation System's coordinate conversion still works correctly
  - Debug Visualization System integration is maintained
  - No changes to existing functionality, only refactoring for better organization
