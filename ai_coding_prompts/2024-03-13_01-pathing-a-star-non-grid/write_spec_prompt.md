Please create a file called spec.md

Copy the contents of this folder's spec-template.md to a new file called spec.md verbatim. Do not make any modifications during this step.

IMPORTANT: For each section of the new spec.md that contains <insert_...> placeholders:
1. First copy that section from the template to spec.md
2. Then ASK ME specifically for input on what should go in that placeholder
3. Wait for my response before filling in that section
4. Once section is filled in, Ask follow up questions if needed to clarify what I want in that placeholder or suggestions on how to improve it

DO NOT fill in any placeholder content yourself. I want to provide the specific content for each <insert_...> section.

IMPORTANT: After you have filled in all the placeholders in spec.md, please ask me to review it before proceeding with the implementation.

Once the spec.md is complete and approved by me, please implement spec.md keeping in mind to follow the instructions and use the files mentioned in the spec.md as references when needed.
