# AStar2D Navigation System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for the non-grid based AStar2D navigation system implemented for the isometric 2D prototype. This system replaces the existing AStarGrid2D implementation while maintaining the same interface for compatibility with existing code.

## Core Components

### 1. AStar2D Navigation Class
- **File**: `a_star_2d_navigation.gd`
- **Purpose**: Handles pathfinding using the AStar2D algorithm in an isometric 2D world
- **Extends**: Node2D (same as original navigation system)

### 2. Coordinate Systems
- **World Coordinates**: The actual position in the game world (Vector2)
- **Grid Coordinates**: A logical grid system that maps to the isometric world (Vector2i)
- **Conversion Functions**: Methods to translate between world and grid coordinates

## Key Features

### 1. Point Management
- **Point Creation**: Creates points based on the tilemap's used rectangle
- **Point IDs**: Each grid position is assigned a unique ID
- **Point Storage**: Stores grid position to ID mappings for quick lookup
- **Custom ID System**: Since AStar2D doesn't use Vector2i for IDs like AStarGrid2D, we implement a custom mapping

### 2. Connection Management
- **Edge Creation**: Connects each node to every other node
- **Bidirectional Connections**: Ensures paths can be traveled in both directions
- **Future Enhancement**: Will support collision detection in future iterations

### 3. Path Finding
- **Path Calculation**: Finds paths between world positions
- **World-to-ID Conversion**: Converts world positions to AStar2D point IDs
- **Path Translation**: Converts AStar2D paths back to world positions
- **Edge Cost Calculation**: Uses Manhattan distance between points for consistent pathing

### 4. Debugging Support
- **Visual Debug**: Displays grid points and paths in the game world
- **Log Debug**: Outputs detailed information about paths and conversions
- **Tile Highlighting**: Shows the selected tile for click positions
- **Connection Visualization**: Optionally shows connections between points

## Interaction with Other Systems

### 1. Character Controller Integration
- **Interface**: Maintains the same interface as the original navigation system
- **Method Calls**: The `character_controller_point_and_click.gd` calls `calculate_path`
- **Path Following**: Character follows the calculated path points

### 2. Tilemap Integration
- **Setup**: Uses the tilemap's dimensions to set up the navigation grid
- **Tile Size**: Uses the isometric tile size (256x128) for coordinate conversions
- **Map Boundaries**: Respects the tilemap's used rectangle for point creation

## Technical Details

### 1. AStar2D Implementation
- **Point Creation**: Each valid tile position becomes a point in the AStar2D graph
- **Point IDs**: Uses a unique integer ID system for AStar2D points (formula: `x * 100000 + y`)
- **Path Finding**: Uses AStar2D's built-in pathfinding algorithm
- **Edge Connection**: All valid points are connected to each other (no collision handling yet)

### 2. Coordinate Conversion
- **World to Grid**: Converts isometric world coordinates to grid coordinates
- **Grid to World**: Converts grid coordinates back to isometric world coordinates
- **Point ID to Position**: Maps AStar2D point IDs to world positions
- **Grid to ID**: Maps grid coordinates to AStar2D point IDs
- **ID to Grid**: Maps AStar2D point IDs back to grid coordinates

### 3. Performance Considerations
- **Point Creation Efficiency**: Points are created once during setup
- **Connection Creation**: Connections are established once during setup
- **Memory Usage**: Stores only necessary data to minimize memory footprint
- **Lookup Tables**: Uses dictionaries for fast coordinate-ID mapping

## Future Enhancements
- **Collision Handling**: Add support for obstacles and impassable terrain
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize point and connection creation for larger maps
- **Dynamic Updates**: Support for runtime changes to the navigation graph
- **Hierarchical Pathfinding**: For larger maps, implement hierarchical pathfinding

## Testing Strategy
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the new navigation system works with the character controller
- **Unit Tests**: Test coordinate conversion, path finding, and other core functions
- **Visual Validation**: Use debug drawing to visually validate paths and grid points
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and unusual path scenarios
